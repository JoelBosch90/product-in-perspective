# Pages
This is the directory of the main index file for the single page application.
This file is served for all requested URLs and it has three purposes:
  - It includes the main javascript file that will start the single page
    application.
  - It includes the styles for all parts of the application.
  - It sets the initial metadata for the app.

Note: any files in this directory besides the index.html exist only for testing
purposes.
